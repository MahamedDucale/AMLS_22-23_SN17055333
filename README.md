Image Classification with CNN
This repository contains code for classifying images using CNN. The folder AMLS_22-23_SN17055333 is organized according to the assignment summary, but does not contain the dataset.

Getting Started
To run the code, you will need the following packages:

keras==2.10.0
matplotlib==3.6.3
pandas==1.5.2
tensorflow==2.11.0
tensorflow_intel==2.11.0
Please make sure that you have these packages installed before running the code.

Running the code
Each file in the repository runs a different CNN model, which uses the dataset to classify images. Running main will run all models, to run a particular model run the corresponding file.

Results
The training accuracy and validation accuracy, as well as the training loss and validation loss will be plotted after each model has been run.

Please note that the actual accuracy may vary depending on the dataset and the specific parameters used in the models.

Acknowledgments
The datasets used in these models are not provided in the repository.
